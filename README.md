### Decal Baking

> Allows you to project any image to a low poly object. Even works if the image uses multiple masks like Normals,roughness,metallic etc.
```DecalMachine materials use a parallax node, which needs to be disabled from the material```

> For TrimFlow users, this is how you setup the bake. All you need to do is move the generated decal mesh into a decal collection which is used by the Bake Set
