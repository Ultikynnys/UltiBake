        <h2>Using Operators in Scripts (Blender Workflow)</h2>
        <p>
            Blender often allows you to discover the Python command associated with an action by right-clicking on a UI element (like a button or menu item) and selecting an option like "Copy Python Command" or "Edit Source". This is a great way to learn how Blender performs operations internally.
            <strong>Important: To ensure options like "Edit Source" or potentially "Copy Python Command" are visible when right-clicking UI elements, make sure "Developer Extras" is enabled in Blender's Preferences (Edit -> Preferences -> Interface -> Display section).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, directly using these copied commands in your own scripts might not always work as expected. Some operators rely heavily on the specific context they are run from (e.g., mouse position, active window type), require complex internal setup, or operate 'modally' (taking over user input temporarily). These factors can make the raw, copied command unsuitable for reliable execution within a script.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API operators documented on this page (like <code>api.run_ultibake</code> below) are specifically designed as <strong>script-friendly wrappers</strong>. They handle the necessary setup or context internally, providing a stable interface that you can reliably call from your Python scripts using <code>bpy.ops.[idname](...)</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, if an Ultibake operation needs to be scripted and has a corresponding API wrapper listed here, you should <strong>use the documented API wrapper</strong>. If a specific Ultibake operator or function is *not* documented here as requiring an API wrapper, you can generally assume that the command copied directly from the Blender UI is suitable for direct use in scripts. Read the sections below for details on how to modify Bake Set parameters or manage sets/units before running an operator.

        <p>
            <strong>Audience & Scope:</strong> This documentation details specific API operators intended for <strong>advanced users</strong> who wish to automate Ultibake workflows using Python scripting.
        </p>
        <p>
            For information on standard extension usage, features, and general setup, please refer to the main <strong>product page</strong>:

        </p>
         <p>
            These wrapped API operators are created <strong>only when necessary</strong> to provide a stable scripting interface for complex operations where Blender's raw operators might be unreliable in scripts. More API wrappers may be added in future updates as needed.

                    Executes the main background baking process provided by the Ultibake extension.
                    This is a wrapper around the core baking logic (`sna.bake_sets_118ea`). Call this operator *after* configuring Bake Set parameters as needed (see Parameter Assignment section below). For preparing meshes for export after baking, see the Finalize operator in the next section.

                <h4>Return Value</h4>
                <p>
                    When called via `bpy.ops`, this operator immediately returns <code>{'FINISHED'}</code> if it successfully initiated the underlying Ultibake process. Note that the actual baking happens in the background (modal operation) and may take time to complete. The return value only indicates successful *initiation*. If the operator cannot start (e.g., due to polling conditions or if the target operator isn't registered), it will return <code>{'CANCELLED'}</code>.

        <section id="parameter-assignment">
            <h2>Parameter Assignment via Script</h2>
            <p>Beyond simply running the API operators, you often need to configure the Bake Sets and Bake Units programmatically before execution. Blender provides a helpful way to find the specific Python data paths for these settings.</p>
            <p>By <strong>right-clicking</strong> on a parameter field in the Ultibake UI (like a UV map selection dropdown, an object input field, a checkbox, or a color swatch) and choosing <strong>"Copy Full Data Path"</strong> (make sure Developer Extras are enabled), you can get the exact Python expression needed to access that property. This typically looks something like <code>bpy.context.scene.sna_objectsets[0].bakeunit[0].activeuvname</code>.</p>
            <p>The examples below demonstrate how to use these data paths to modify common Bake Set and Bake Unit settings before calling an operator like <code>api.run_ultibake</code>. Remember that Ultibake settings are stored <strong>per Scene</strong>.</p>
            <h4>Setting the Target UV Map</h4>
            <p>Each Bake Unit targets a specific UV Map on the low-poly object for baking. You can change this target UV map name:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
import bpy
scene = bpy.context.scene # Assuming context scene is correct one

# Check if Bake Sets exist and access the first one (index 0)
if scene.sna_objectsets:
    bake_set = scene.sna_objectsets[0]
    # Check if Bake Units exist and access the first one (index 0)
    if bake_set.bakeunit:
        bake_unit = bake_set.bakeunit[0]
        # Set the active UV map name (replace with your actual UV map name)
        bake_unit.activeuvname = "TARGET_UVMAP_NAME"
        print(f"Set active UV map for BU 0 in BS 0 to: {bake_unit.activeuvname}")
            </code></pre>
            <h4>Assigning Objects & Decals Collection</h4>
            <p>Assign specific Blender objects or collections to the different roles within a Bake Unit:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
# Assuming bake_unit is defined as above (scene.sna_objectsets[0].bakeunit[0])

# Assign Low Poly object
if 'Suzanne_LP' in bpy.data.objects:
    bake_unit.low = bpy.data.objects['Suzanne_LP']
    print(f"Assigned low poly: {bake_unit.low.name}")

# Assign High Poly object
if 'Suzanne_HP' in bpy.data.objects:
    bake_unit.high = bpy.data.objects['Suzanne_HP']
    print(f"Assigned high poly: {bake_unit.high.name}")

# Assign Cage object
if 'Suzanne_Cage' in bpy.data.objects:
    bake_unit.cage = bpy.data.objects['Suzanne_Cage']
    print(f"Assigned cage: {bake_unit.cage.name}")

# Assign Decals Collection
if 'MyDecals' in bpy.data.collections:
    bake_unit.decals = bpy.data.collections['MyDecals']
    print(f"Assigned decals collection: {bake_unit.decals.name}")
            </code></pre>
            <h4>Setting Color ID</h4>
            <p>Set the RGB color (values 0.0 to 1.0) used by the Color ID bake type:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
# Assuming bake_unit is defined as above

# Set Color ID to pure Red
bake_unit.color = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
print(f"Set Color ID to: {bake_unit.color[:]}")
            </code></pre>
            <h4>Setting the Active Profile</h4>
            <p>Select the Profile (which defines active Bake Types) by its name before baking:</p>
             <pre><code class="language-python">
# Assuming bake_set is defined as above (scene.sna_objectsets[0])

# Replace "My_ColorID_Profile" with the exact name of your profile
profile_name = "My_ColorID_Profile"
# Optional: Check if profile exists in the specific bake_set if needed
# bake_set.profiles is likely where profiles are stored per set
bake_set.currentprofile = profile_name
print(f"Set current profile for BS 0 to: {bake_set.currentprofile}")

            </code></pre>
            <p><em>Tip:</em> It's often easier to configure complex profiles using the UI once, save the <code>.blend</code> file, and then load that file for automated baking, especially for headless operation.</p>
            <h4>Using Collection Mode for Low Polys</h4>
            <p>Bake all objects within a collection as low-polys (High, Cage, Decals cannot be assigned per-object in this mode):</p>
             <pre><code class="language-python">
# Assuming bake_unit is defined as above

# Assign the collection containing low poly objects
low_poly_collection_name = 'MyLowPolyObjects'
if low_poly_collection_name in bpy.data.collections:
    bake_unit.lowcollection = bpy.data.collections[low_poly_collection_name]
    bake_unit.usecollection = True # Enable collection mode AFTER assigning
    print(f"Enabled collection mode using collection: {bake_unit.lowcollection.name}")
else:
    bake_unit.usecollection = False # Ensure it's disabled if collection missing
    print(f"Warning: Collection '{low_poly_collection_name}' not found. Collection mode disabled.")

            <h2>Finalizing & Exporting Results</h2>

            <p>After baking textures using an operator like <code>api.run_ultibake</code>, Ultibake provides a dedicated operator to prepare meshes for export: <code>bpy.ops.sna.create_finalized_meshes_b853c()</code>. </p>
            <p>This "Finalize" operator creates **new mesh objects** based on the low-poly sources defined in your Bake Sets. These new objects typically have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A single material slot using the newly baked textures.</li>
                <li>A name derived from the original object, the Bake Set's Texture Name, and the scene's Export Suffix (<code>{original_object_name}_{texturename}_{exportsuffix}</code>, where suffix comes from <code>bpy.context.scene.sna_finalizesuffix</code>).</li>
                <li>All UV maps copied from the original low-poly source (you might need to clean these up later, see below).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To programmatically export these finalized objects (e.g., to FBX for game engines), you first need to identify and select them. A common method is to compare the objects present in the scene before and after running the Finalize operator:</p>
