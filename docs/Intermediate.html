		This is what you're actually baking when you hit the bake button.
		<br>
		<br>
		Note. some of the names do not match, and this is by design, blender uses a very strange naming scheme for some of these nodes, which may be confusing for people who work with Unity or Unreal.
		If you do need to know what node each channel corresponds, you can mouse over the values in the baking set, which will reveal the exact BSDF Input you're about to bake. For Blender 4.0 users, the node looks a bit different, but it still functions the same.

		<h2 class="major">Creating Multiple Baking Sets</h2>

		<p>
			Here is a simple material, sampling the voronoi node in blender in various ways. For each texture type, we need a baking set, like in the image above.
			<br>
			<br>
			Note. To the right of each baking set there are Coloured letters representing the target channel to which bake the corresponding bake type.
			We can see that the Normal and Color channels use 3 channels by default and that black/white masks use the alpha channel by default.
			Let's change that so we only need 2 textures instead of 4.

		<h2 class="major">Channel packing</h2>
		<span class="image fit"><img src="https://github.com/Ultikynnys/UltiBake/tree/main/docs/_media/9.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p>
			We can simply just call the textures the same name to tell the baker to combine them. The resulting textures will be RGBA. When baking RGBA it is crucial to not use jpg(no alpha channel) or png(premultiplied alpha) as these will ruin the textures <br>( C = Color, N = Normal, M = Metallic, R = Roughness, this is a pretty common naming scheme for textures)
			<br>
			<br>
			Note. In general, the more textures you have, the worse your shader will perform, as sampling a texture is the most expensive thing a GPU can do, so it is good practice to reduce the amount
			of textures where possible, by doing a technique called <a href="http://wiki.polycount.com/wiki/ChannelPacking"> Channel Packing</a>

		<p>
			Here I've opened the resulting files in photoshop, here we can see that all the channels have been baked correctly.

Opening up the Image in Blender will have you believe that the color channel has been compromised by the alpha, but this is just a visual bug in Blender, unless you're using png, which does actually affect the color channel.
